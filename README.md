<b>Explaination of Topic Chosen and Idea behind it:</b><br>
Sleep Health and Lifestyle: A Visual Exploration is a data visualization project that explores the relationship
between sleep health and lifestyle factors. It uses data from various sources to show how different lifestyle
choices, such as diet, exercise, and stress, can affect our sleep. Sleep is essential for good health and well-being.
It allows our bodies and minds to rest and repair, and it helps us to function at our best. However, many
people do not get enough sleep, and this can have negative consequences for our health. Our lifestyle choices
can have a significant impact on our sleep health. For example, regular exercise can help to improve sleep
quality, but it is important to avoid exercising too close to bedtime. Stress can also make it difficult to
fall asleep and stay asleep. There are a number of different stress management techniques that can help to
improve sleep quality. This data visualization project tells a story about sleep health and how to improve it.
It is important because it helps people to understand the importance of sleep and make better choices about
their lifestyle. The project uses visualization to make the data more engaging and easier to understand.<br>
